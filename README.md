### Team Members:

* Wang Yuyang 19206226
* Yang Liuxin 19206207

### Introduction

The website should allow multiple grocery shops to set up products available, along with their unit prices as well as images. 
The website should allow users to visit different shops, and put items into their basket. The website should allow users to view their basket at all times, and add/remove items from the basket. 
The website should allow users to increase/ decrease the quantity of the items while looking at their baskets. 
It should also calculate the total expenditure/cost for all items in the basket. 
Finally, it should create an itemised list of the userâ€™s shopping bill, grouped by the shop.
